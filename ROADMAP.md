# Project Roadmap: College Management System

## 🚀 Powerful New Features

- [ ] **1. Role-Based Access Control (Admin vs. Faculty vs. Student)**
  - *Goal:* Create separate roles. Faculty can only add attendance/marks. Students can log in to view their own grades and fees. Admins have full access.
  
- [ ] **2. Student Dashboard / Portal**
  - *Goal:* Create a dedicated portal where a student logs in to see a summary of their Attendance %, Academic Grades, and Fee Status in one clean view.

- [ ] **3. Data Export & Reporting (PDF / Excel)**
  - *Goal:* Add a "Download Report" button on the Students, Marks, and Fees pages to export lists of fee defaulters, top-performing students, or low-attendance students to CSV or PDF.

- [ ] **4. Email / SMS Notification System**
  - *Goal:* Integrate an email service to automatically alert students when their fees are due, or when their attendance drops below the 75% threshold.

- [ ] **5. Library Management Module**
  - *Goal:* Add a module to track college library books, scan book IDs, issue books to students, and calculate late fines.

## 🎨 Modern UI Improvements

- [ ] **1. Interactive Dashboard Charts (Chart.js)**
  - *Goal:* Integrate Chart.js to show a pie chart of Fee Status, a bar chart of Average Marks by Branch, or a line graph of Attendance Trends.

- [ ] **2. Search Bars & Pagination**
  - *Goal:* Add real-time search bars and page numbers (pagination) to Data Tables to make scrolling through massive data sets faster.

- [ ] **3. Floating "Toast" Notifications**
  - *Goal:* Convert flash messages into modern "Toast" notifications that slide in cleanly at the bottom right of the screen and disappear after 3 seconds.

- [ ] **4. Add/Edit using Modal Popups**
  - *Goal:* Convert full-page forms (like /add_fees or /update_student) into sleek modal overlays right over the table.

- [ ] **5. Profile Pictures**
  - *Goal:* Add image upload functionality to display small circular avatars next to Student and Faculty names in the lists.

- [ ] **6. Card-Based Mobile Layouts**
  - *Goal:* Write CSS media queries to convert table rows into vertical "Cards" when viewed on smartphones.
